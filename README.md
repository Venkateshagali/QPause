# QPause – Quantum Resistant Secure Cloud Storage

QPause (Quantum Access Control for Sensitive Cloud Storage) is a security-focused web application designed to protect cloud-stored data against both classical and future quantum computing threats. The project combines password-based authentication, distributed secret sharing, and post-quantum cryptography to ensure long-term data confidentiality.

## 🔐 Key Features
- Quantum-resistant security using lattice-based cryptography (LWE)
- Password Protected Secure Sharing (PPSS) for key management
- Distributed key storage to eliminate single points of failure
- Role-based access control (Data Owner, User, CSP, Key Server)
- Secure encrypted data upload and controlled data retrieval
- Protection against password and active server attacks

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Java / J2EE (JSP, Servlets)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Web Server:** Apache Tomcat
- **Security:** Lattice-based Post-Quantum Cryptography

## 👥 User Roles
- **Data Owner:** Uploads and manages encrypted datasets
- **End User:** Requests keys and downloads authorized data
- **Cloud Service Provider (CSP):** Stores encrypted data and monitors security
- **Key Server:** Manages and distributes encryption key shares

## 🎯 Objectives
- Ensure future-proof security against quantum attacks
- Provide strong user-controlled access to cloud data
- Improve password-based security with secret sharing
- Maintain usability with high security guarantees
